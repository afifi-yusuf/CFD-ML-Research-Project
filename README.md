Introduction

The goal of this research project is to develop a predictive model for shallow water perturbations using LSTM networks. The model is designed to operate in a latent space derived from simulations of shallow water flows, enabling more efficient and accurate predictions of dynamic changes.

Data Generation

The dataset for this project was created by simulating shallow water flows using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) techniques. The generated data consists of various perturbations that the LSTM model will learn to predict.

Model Architecture

The LSTM model is implemented in the model.py file. Key features of the architecture include:

	•	Input Layer: Accepts input data from the latent space.
	•	LSTM Layers: Stacked LSTM layers to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
	•	Output Layer: Produces predictions for shallow water perturbations.
